funcLearn
=========
funcLearn is a matlab package for performing machine learning tasks when inputs,
and possibly outputs, are functions or distributions or sets. 

I've tried to write the code to balance both performance and readability.
The code is still very beta but hopefully will illustrate the methods in:

Installation
-------------
In order to use funcLearn you have to have [mtimesx](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25977-mtimesx-fast-matrix-multiply-with-multi-dimensional-support/content/mtimesx.m) installed and functioning correctly.
On unix machines you may need to use the following command to compile:
``` 
mex -largeArrayDims -DDEFINEUNIX mtimesx.c -lmwblas
```
Make sure that funcLearn is in you matlab path, either run:
``` 
fl_setup
```
or
``` 
addpath(genpath('/path/to/funcLearn/'))
```

Demos
--------
Please see the following scripts to illustrate how to do various functional based ML tasks:
>- `demos/getpcs_demo.m`
